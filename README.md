# OOP Todo App 

This project was created while I was going through Launch School's RB175 course which is about networked applications. During 175, we built a todo app without using an OOP approach. I decided to use a previous code built in OOP approach using Sinatra. I used YAML file to persist data. 

The main motivation behind creating this project was actually to support another optional project that I build with other students in Launch School. We were all interested in creating an optional project using the OOP approach but without getting into databases because we haven't reached that part of Launch School's course yet. 

I also wanted to check how soon the YAML would reset when hosted on Heroku. Checking this helped give me and the other students the motivation to work on converting our other app to a database backed application.
